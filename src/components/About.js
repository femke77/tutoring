        I've been coding in various languages and paradigms for a little over 10
        years. My BS degree is in Computer Science, and I currently work for edX
        as a tutor, a TA, and a occasional substitute instructor for the Full
        Stack program. I am certified in MERN stack and Java/Spring/React by
        UCLA and SMU respectively. I studied relational databases (SQL Server)
        at the graduate level, along with data science and machine learning. My
        team won 2nd place in the 2018 AI Jam which sprung us into the world of
        creating our own startup! I am the{" "}

        I have a strong passion for coding. You can say it verges on an
        obsession at times. Every bug is a puzzle that I just can't wait to
        squash!

        Helping students learn to code is something I find not only fun but
        rewarding. I am excited to help you learn and grow your MERN stack
        skills.
